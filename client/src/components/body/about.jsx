      This is a simple block of text that's going to address things about myself.  My name is Christopher Pham and I go by the alias of Ciang, pronounced 'CEE-AH-NG'.  I've been coding at a very ripe age of 11 years, first starting off with coding out Pokemon websites.  I was a rather curious coder at that age and was attracted to the idea of bringing in traffic and what sort of things I could do to improve traffic after creating my own minimal viable product.

      After doing extensive research, relative to what an 11-year-old would deem as extensive research, the angelfire page that hosted my Pokemon website was generating traffic in the thousands, with a peak traffic of 10,000 unique users per day.  I took advantage of this traffic by setting up ads on my page, and at that age I figured out how to make some extra pocket money that seemed rather, well, a lot at that age considering the amount of allowance given to me per day was $5 from my parents.

      I was very excited to see the progress I was making and wanted to learn more, but was intercepted by my father to focus on school insteading of web coding shenanigans.  So I regretfully abandoned my coding projects and attempted to focus on school instead.  I was involved heavily in choir and church in high school, and was placed in the highest rank for choral music, known as "Vocal Ensemble".  We were a touring choir and for my senior year, we competed in Hawaii and took first place.  I also served in church as a worship and praise leader for a number of years.  Post graduation, a good friend from church asked me to join a music competition called "Kollaboration", a Korean american music competition that was being held in LA that had hundreds of applicants.  I acquiesced and tried out for the competition and made the cut, where they narrowed down the number of acts to 10.

      Long story short, we entered that competition and took first place, which deterred me away completely from the path of programming and into the path of pursuing a music career.  Winning the competition earned us a spot to record an EP with MIT and Juilliard's very own, Woody Pak, CEO of Chaos Theory Music.  His company enabled us to perform and tour around the United States with the cause of raising Bone Marrow awareness for the Cammy Lee Leukemia Foundation, record an EP and a number of singles, a music video, and more.  His company had also introduced me to a prestigious modeling company called "Q Model Management", and so they received me and I modelled as a commercial and print model for four years, doing jobs for companies like Apple, Target, Chrysler, PacSun, and other companies.

      Eventually, there came a point where pursuing feats in the entertainment industry had its own set of limitations which in turn drove the direction of the music group that I was with into more lucrative pathing.  The bass player, who remains as one of my closest friends til this very day, pursued medicine and is now officially a doctor serving his residency at UCI's Medical Center.  The drummer in my band now works as a graphic designer for Samsung, and all the while as we were in the band, our electric guitarist had already a position as an aeronautical engineer at Boeing.

      This left me in a bit of a limbo, figuring out what I wanted to pursue as a long-term career, and thus inquired within myself to go back to my roots -- coding.

      I began my pursuit in computer science for a number of years at a local community college, built up knowledge and credentials, and served as a lab intern, teacher assistant, and student tutor for the purposes of expanding my knowledge in the field.  I got into advanced Data Structures written in C++, and decided the current paradigm of education was limiting my pursuit in computer science, and decided to go the bootcamp route.
      </p>

      <p>
      I applied to Hack Reactor bootcamp, which has an all-time low acceptance rate of 3%, passed their technical interview, and began my program there in Playa Vista.  Students who had been accepted had come from many different walks and paths of life, but primarily students who have already attended universities such as Berkeley, UCLA, UCI, neighboring Cal States and even some candidates from out of state.  The first six weeks as a junior software engineer in training was a challenging journey, as there were a number of tech stacks that had to be picked up in a very small window of time.
      </p>

      <p>
      These frameworks included fundamental JavaScript, Data Structures and Algorithms in Javascript, React, jQuery, HTML, CSS, Webpack, Babel, MySQL, Sequelize, MongoDB, SqLite.  The technical assessment which determines who passes into the senior phase was given right after week 6, to test junior software engineers on these topics.  Our class first started with 13 people and dwindled down to 8, so myself and seven others passed into the senior phase successfully in Hack Reactor.
      </p>

      <p>
      Senior Phase trained us on furthering our abilities of autonomy to pick up new tech stacks, with all the while exploring different ways to investigate stress testing and benchmarking when developing backend system architecture and design.
